# MoonScape
A game engine built from scratch that uses ray casters to create a 3D illusion from a 2D grid.

## Instructions
To beat the game, the player must find the exit door on the map. But wait! First you must find and take the Golden Bracelet that allows you to open the locked door leading to the exit. While looking for the Bracelet and the exit door, you can either fight or avoid the enemies trying to stop them. But be careful, because if your health drops to 0, you lose the game and must start over.
